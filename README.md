## :rocket: About the Project

_This is a work of my own, where I use [SMART CONTRACT TECHNOLOGY (SOLIDITY)](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.17/), [BLOCKCHAIN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain), [WEB3](https://web3.foundation/about/) and [METAMASK](https://metamask.io/) to simulate [TSE](https://www.tse.jus.br/) ballot boxes, and most importantly, with transparent votes and without it being possible to tamper with them in any way._

## :electric_plug: How to use

This README is from the root directory, in this case, this project will be a monorepository, where it will contain the root hierarchy and two hierarchies, which are:

- **FRONTEND (Web3)**
- **SOLIDITY (Smart Contracts)**

Each project will contain its own hierarchy and dependency control, so to learn more about each project, go to each project's main folder.

## :memo: License

See the [LICENSE](LICENSE) for more details.

## :heartpulse: Sponsor

Made with â™¥ and with the intention of learning and passing on knowledge.

So that I can work full-time and open to the community, thus bringing more relevance and technological solutions. It would mean a lot to me and the whole community if you help me reach this goal.
